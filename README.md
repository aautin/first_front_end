# Minimalist Website

This is my first full-stack websocket, where I built both the backend and frontend from scratch.

## Overview
- **Backend**: Built using Node.js and Express.js to handle routes and data.
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the data.
- **Main Goal**: Coming soon...

## Setup and launch
Command to execute from the root of the repository
- **Global**: (install curl and nodejs v20)
```bash
   sudo apt-get install curl
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```
- **Back**:
```bash
   cd back
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```
-  **Front**:
```bash
   cd from
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

## How It Works
- Coming soon...
