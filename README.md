# Minimalist Website

This is my first full-stack route, where I built both the backend and frontend from scratch.

## Overview
- **Backend**: Built using Node.js and Express.js to handle routes and data.
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the data.
- **Main Goal**: Learn how to make a full request cycle from frontend to backend.

## Setup and launch
Command to execute from the root of the repository
- **Back**:
```bash
   cd back
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```
-  **Front**:
```bash
   cd from
   npm install
   npm run live-server
   npm run tsc
   ```

## How It Works
- The frontend sends requests to the backend.
- The backend processes the request and sends back a response.
- The frontend displays the response data.

This project helped me understand the basics of connecting the front and back end of a web application.
